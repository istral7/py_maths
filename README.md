# py_maths

## Description
py_maths is a Python library of mathematical equations and formulae that can be used in primarily mathematical programs to reduce the workload of program designers, when developing new programs.
NB. The library will contain functions, which are written in pure Python (no external libraries such as NumPy,SciPy,etc. are being used in the final code). However, that doesn't prevent contributors from using other libraries to aid in the creation of these functions.

## Installation


## Usage


## Roadmap
Future releases will include;
- defining functions for working with complex numbers

## Contributing
Pull requests are generally welcome, although this depends on the project within this repository (please consult the individual project's outline). For major changes to a project, please address it through opening an issue in order to discuss what merits the change(s) you are proposing.

## Project status
At the moment, py_maths is being updated with various approximation methods and equations relating to calculus.
Once a significant number of resources for calculus have been added, the intention is to move onto developing resources for complex numbers.
